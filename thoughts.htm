<LI> "Hitherto the Industrial Revolution has been based essentially on the 
exploitation of inanimate energy derived from irreplaceable sources ... One 
can summarize the story of our happy generations in the following way: for 
millions of years wealth was stored and cumulated. Then, someone in the family 
discovered the hoard - and started to dissipate it. We are now living through 
this fabulous dissipation. Humanity is today consuming more coal in a single 
year than had been generated in a hundred centuries or so during the process 
of carbonization." (Carlo M. Cipolla, <I>The Economic History of World Population</I>,

<LI> "We are not used to thinking of ideas as economic goods, but they are surely
the most significant ones that we produce ... We once used iron oxide as
a pigment in cave paintings. An elaborate set of ideas now lets us use
it to store magnetic signals on audio cassettes, video cassettes and computer
disk drives." (Paul Romer (1993), <I>150 Economist Years</I>, page 86).</LI>

<LI> "Good work is rightly appreciated, inventions and improvements in machinery, 
in process and the general organization of the business have their merits promptly 
discussed: if one man starts a new idea, it is taken up by others and combined with 
suggestions of their own; and thus becomes the source of further new ideas."

<LI> "Yet the gross national product does not allow for the health of our children, 
the quality of their education or the joy of their play.  It does not include the 
beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public 
debate or the integrity of our public officials.  It measures neither our wit nor our 
courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion 
to our country, it measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile."

effects of the division of labour." (Adam Smith, <I>The Wealth of Nations</I>, Book I, Chapter I)

<LI>"The spirit of trade cannot coexist with war, and sooner or later this spirit dominates every people." (Immanuel Kant, 
<I>Perpetual Peace and Other Essays</I>)</LI>

<P>


<LI> "The natural effect of trade is to bring about peace. Two nations which trade together, render
themselves reciprocally dependent; for if one has an interest in buying, the other has an
interest in selling; and all unions are based upon mutual needs." (Montesquieu, <I>De l’esprit
des Lois</I>, 1758)</LI>

<P>

<LI> "I will never falter in my belief that enduring peace and the welfare of nations are indissolubly
connected with friendliness, fairness, equality, and the maximum practicable degree
of freedom in international trade." (Cordell Hull, U.S. secretary of state, 1933–1944)</LI>

<P>


<LI> "Part of the difficulty in accepting the good news about trade is in our words. We too often talk about trade while using the vocabulary of war. In war, for one side to win, the other must lose. But commerce is not warfare. Trade is an economic alliance that benefits both countries. There are no losers, only winners. And trade helps strengthen the free world." (President Ronald W. Reagan)

<P>

<LI> "So it is upon the sea-coast, and along the banks of navigable rivers, that industry of every kind naturally begins to subdivide and improve itself, and it is frequently not till a long time after that those improvements extend themselves to the inland parts of the country." (Adam Smith, <I>The Wealth of Nations</I>, 1776)

<P>

<LI> "It is the maxim of every prudent master of a family, never to attempt to make at home what it will cost more to make than to buy." (Adam Smith, <I>The Wealth of Nations</I>, 1776)

<P>

<LI> "By such maxims as these, however, nations have been taught that their interest consisted in beggaring all their neighbours. Each nation has been made to look with an invidious eye upon the prosperity of all the nations with which it trades, and to consider their gain as its own loss. Commerce, which ought naturally to be, among nations, as among individuals, a bond of union and friendship, has become the most fertile source of discord and animosity." (Adam Smith, <I>The Wealth of Nations</I>, 1776)

<P>

<LI> "A protectionist measure provides large benefits to a small number of people, 
and causes a very great number of consumers a slight loss." (Vilfredo Pareto, <I>Manual 
of Political Economy</I>, 1909)</LI>

<P>

<LI> "Before we were a trading people, ... we ... lived in a kind of penury, a stranger to money or affluence, inconsiderable in ourselves, and of no consequence to our neighbors." (R Cambbell, <I>The London Tradesman</I>, 1747, pages 284-5)

<P>

<LI> "A realm can never be rich that hath not an intercourse and trade of merchandise with other nations" (William Cecil, cited in Francis Peck, <I>Desiderata Curiosa</I>, 1779)

<P>

<LI> "The popular view that free trade is all very well so long as all nations
are free-traders, but that when other nations erect tariffs we must erect
tarifss too, is countered by the argument that it would be just as sensible
to drop rocks into our own harbours because other nations have rocky coasts
...." (Joan Robinson, <I>Essays in the Theory of Employment</I>, Oxford:
Blackwell, 1947)</LI>

<P>

<LI> "What an extraordinary episode in the economic progress of man that age was which came to an end
in August 1914! ... The inhabitant of London could order by telephone, sipping his morning tea in bed, 
the various products of the whole earth, in such quantity as we might see fit, and reasonably expect 
their early delivery upon his doorstep; he could at the same moment and by the same means adventure 
his wealth in the natural resources and new enterprises of any quarter of the world, and share, 
without exertion or even trouble, in their prospective fruits and advantages." (John Maynard Keynes, 
<I>The Economic Consequences of the Peace</I>, New York: Harcourt, 1920, p. 11)

<P>

<LI> "In a regime of Free Trade and free economic intercourse it would be of little consequence that iron
lay on one side of a political frontier, and labor, coal, and blast furnaces on the other. But as it is,
men have devised ways to impoverish themselves and one another; and prefer collective animosities
to individual happiness." (John Maynard Keynes, <I>The Economic Consequences of the Peace</I>, New York:
Harcourt, 1920, p. 99)

<P>

<LI> "It is the maxim of every prudent master of a family, never to attempt to make at home what it will 
cost him more to make than to buy. The taylor does not attempt to make his own shoes, but buys them of 
the shoemaker. The shoemaker does not attempt to make his own clothes, but employs a taylor. The farmer 
attempts to make neither the one nor the other, but employs those different artificers. All of them 
find it for their interest to employ their whole industry in a way in which they have some advantage 
over their neighbours, and to purchase with a part of its produce, or what is the same thing, with the
price of a part of it, whatever else they have occasion for. What is prudence in the conduct of every 
private family, can scarce be folly in that of a great kingdom. If a foreign country can supply us 
with a commodity cheaper than we ourselves can make it, better buy it of them with some part
of the produce of our own industry, employed in a way in which we have some
advantage." (Adam Smith, <I>The Wealth of Nations</I>, New York: The Modern Library 1937, p. 424).

<P>

<LI> "Modern industry has established the world market ... All old established national
industries ... are dislodged by new industries whose ... products are consumed, not only 
at home, but in every quarter of the globe. In place of the old wants ... we find new 
wants, requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes."

(Edward Leamer, <I>Sources of International Comparative Advantage: Theory and Evidence</I>,
MIT Press, 1984)</LI>

<P>

<LI> "One of the best ways to understand how the international economy works is to start looking at what happens inside nations ...
The data will be better and pose fewer problems of compatibility, and the underlying economic forces will be less distorted by government policies."
(Paul Krugman, <I>Geography and Trade</I>, MIT Press, 1991)</LI>

<P>

<LI> "If there is one single area of economics in which path dependence is unmistakable, it is in economic 
geography - the location of production in space. The long shadow cast by history over location is apparent at all
scales, from the smallest to the largest." (Paul Krugman, <I>Geography and Trade</I>, MIT Press, 1991)</LI>

<P>

<LI> "Saying that trade policy exists because it serves to transfer income to favored groups is a bit like saying Sir Edmund Hillary 
climbed Mount Everest because he wanted to get some mountain air." (Dani Rodrik, Chapter 28 in <I>Handbook of International 
Economics</I>, vol 3, page 1470)

be united in close embrace, without losing your identity or striking originality. ... A day will come in which
markets open to commerce and minds open to ideas will be the sole battlefields." (Victor Hugo, 1861)

<P>

<LI> "And what is the plight to which Europe has been reduced? ... over wide areas a vast quivering mass of tormented, 
hungry, care-worn and bewildered human beings gape at the ruins of their cities and their homes, and scan the dark 
horizons for the approach of some new peril, tyranny or terror. ... That is all that Europeans, grouped in so many 
ancient states and nations ... have got by tearing each other to pieces and spreading havoc far and wide. Yet all 
the while there is a remedy ... It is to recreate the European family, or as much of it as we can, and to provide 
it with a structure under which it can dwell in peace, in safety and in freedom. We must build a kind of United 
States of Europe" (Winston S. Churchill, Zurich, 19 September, 1946)

<LI> "To my way of thinking, the true functions of analytical economics are best described informally: to organize our necessarily incomplete perceptions about the economy, to see connections that the untutored eye would miss, to tell plausible - sometimes even convincing - causal stories with the help of a few central principle, and to make rough quantitative judgments about the consequences of economic policy and other exogenous events."
