<H3>Job Market Preparation</H3>

<P>

There is also an old adage about having to write a book twice. Once in order to work out what to say and 
twice in order to work out how to say it. Given that job market packs have to be sent out in November, 
this means that you should have a complete draft of a job market paper by the Summer 
of the year you intend to go on the market, so that you can spend September and October polishing 
the finer details of the analysis.

In the year before you go on the job market, you should try to present your work at conferences such as 
Empirical Investigations in International Trade, Mid-West International Trade Meeting, Royal Economic Society Conference, 
European Economic Association, and European Trade Study Group. Try to get as much practice presenting your work 
and responding to comments as possible.
